1. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to the website `https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html`.

2. Right-click on the webpage and select "Inspect" or press the Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Command+Option+I (Mac) key combination to open the Developer Tools.

3. Find the path to the `crawl-data.js` file in the source. Typically, the path will look like `src/data/crawl-data.js`. 

4. In the "Console" tab of the Developer Tools, paste the code you copied from the `crawl-data.js` file.
